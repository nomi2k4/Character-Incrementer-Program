Character Incrementer Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program takes a character input from the user and displays the next character in the ASCII sequence.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input a character
- Uses the prefix increment operator (++a) to increment the ASCII value of the character
- Displays the next character in the ASCII sequence

Features:

- User input for character
- Use of prefix increment operator for character increment
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./character_incrementer
    - On Windows: character_incrementer.exe
4. Enter a character when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using prefix increment operator for variable increment
- Working with character variables and ASCII sequence
- Basic character manipulation logic
